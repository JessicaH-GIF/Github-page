<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Johnathan Sinclare<br><b>Location:</b><br>Residential sub-level Workspace<b>Case Number:</b> MP-O26-JX<br><b>Date of Entry:</b> 15 February 2026</p><br>

<p>A systematic search of the subject's residential basement was conducted following notification of his disappearance on 14 February 2026. The environment displayed signs of extensive technical modification inconsistency with standard personal computing or registered occupational duties.</p>

<p>The following items were recovered:</p>

<h3>ITEM 001: Multi-Display Processing Station</h3>
<p>A six-monitor computing array configured for parallel runtime simulation was located along the north-facing wall of the workspace. Device logs indicate sustained operational activity during late-night hours, with no signs of interruption or shutdown until the subject's disappearance.</p>

<h3>ITEM 002: PROTOTYPE HARDWARE COMPONENTS</h3>
<p>Several custom-built hardware components were found in a locked storage compartment within the workspace. These components appear to be part of an experimental computing system, with no known commercial equivalent. Initial analysis suggests they were designed for high-performance processing and data encryption. Unregistered mechenical components include; sensor arrays and modified micro-proccesing units were concealed beneath a storage unit.</p>

<h3>ITEM 003:PERSONAL DOCUMENTATION LOGS</h3>
<p>Handwritten journals detailing structured developmental phases of an unnamed technical system were located near the subject's desk area.<br>Recurrent documentated entries include;<br>-Response latency reduced<br>-Host interaction inconsistent<br>-Environmental noise interferring<br>-Still adapting</p>

<h2>IVESTIGATOR'S NOTE:</h2>
<p>The basement environment contained technical infrastructure unrelated to the subject's documented occupational responsibilities and suggests the development of an independent experimental system requiring environmental monitoring and containment protocols.</p>
